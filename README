# ETP Herwig event generation

Repository for tracking the development of distributable MC event generation with Herwig.


## Herwig Docker image

This repository provides a Docker image for running standalone Herwig. 
See also the linked [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mhorzela/herwig-standalone). 
This image contains a full installation of Herwig with all necessary linked software components. 
Since the size of the docker image is quite big (aprox. 8.5GiB) it might not be the best option to use for distributed execution in a batch system. 


## Law setup

TODO: For automated and distributed production of HEP-particle-collision events with Herwig, exploiting all functionality, an implementation of the workflow using [LAW](https://github.com/riga/law) is provided.
