    pp collision, 13 TeV, jets with anti-kt algorithm with jet size parameters of
    $R = 0.4$ and $R = 0.8$; only events with at least two jets up to $|y| = 5.0$
    are selected and the first and second $p_T$-leading jets are required to have
    $|y| < 3.0$, as well as transverse momenta greater than 100 and 50 GeV,
    respectively.
